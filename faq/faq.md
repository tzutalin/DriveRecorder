## How Loop Recording work

When you go to the setting of this app, you can select the max storage size of all files.

For example, if you choose 10 GB, when the size of all videos reaches 10GB, the app will start deleting the oldest video.

#### What happens if the length of one video exceeds the file storage limitation?

It will stop the current recording, and start a new one to override the current recording.

## How to output the time stamp to a video

There are two options

1. Go to the video player and select `Output a video with timestamp`. However, it does not support all devices. Some of old devices or certain devices using x86 CPU are unable to do this. You can go with the second option.

2. Go to setting and login EnVsion, then go to video player and share your video to [https://app.getdash.ai/](https://app.getdash.ai/)
